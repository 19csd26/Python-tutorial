### Polymorphism 
Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same message (i.e., method call) in different ways. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, which allows subclasses to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly if they respond to the same method call.

Here's an example to illustrate polymorphism in Python:

```python
class Animal:
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

class Cow(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Moo!"

# Function to make animal sounds
def animal_sounds(animal):
    return animal.make_sound()

# Creating instances of different animals
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()
cow = Cow()

# Polymorphic behavior
print(animal_sounds(dog))  # Output: Woof!
print(animal_sounds(cat))  # Output: Meow!
print(animal_sounds(cow))  # Output: Moo!

```
In this example:

We have a base class Animal with a method make_sound(), which is overridden by subclasses Dog, Cat, and Cow.
The animal_sounds() function takes an object of type Animal (or any subclass of Animal) as a parameter and calls its make_sound() method.
When we pass different animal objects to the animal_sounds() function, polymorphism allows the correct make_sound() method of each object to be called based on its actual type.
Even though animal_sounds() function is only defined once, it behaves differently depending on the type of object passed to it, demonstrating polymorphic behavior.
Polymorphism enables code reuse, flexibility, and extensibility in object-oriented programming, allowing for more modular and maintainable code.
