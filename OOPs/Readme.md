### Polymorphism 
Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same message (i.e., method call) in different ways. In Python, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, which allows subclasses to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly if they respond to the same method call.

Here's an example to illustrate polymorphism in Python:

```python
class Animal:
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"

class Cow(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Moo!"

# Function to make animal sounds
def animal_sounds(animal):
    return animal.make_sound()

# Creating instances of different animals
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()
cow = Cow()

# Polymorphic behavior
print(animal_sounds(dog))  # Output: Woof!
print(animal_sounds(cat))  # Output: Meow!
print(animal_sounds(cow))  # Output: Moo!

```
