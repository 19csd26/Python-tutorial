# Simple Python program to understand the if statement  
num = int(input("enter the number:"))         
# Here, we are taking an integer num and taking input dynamically  
if num%2 == 0:      
# Here, we are checking the condition. If the condition is true, we will enter the block  
    print("The Given number is an even number")
