# Decision Making in Python

In Python, decision-making refers to the process of executing different code blocks based on certain conditions. This is typically achieved using conditional statements such as `if`, `elif` (else if), and `else`. Decision-making allows programs to make choices and execute specific actions based on the evaluation of conditions.
